# 🔐 PrivLabs — Supply Chain Security Toolkit

PrivLabs Supply Chain Security Toolkit is an **offline pre-audit security platform**
designed to assess **supply-chain attack surfaces** before exploitation.

It helps security teams, consultants, and organizations **identify, prioritize, and
communicate risk** across infrastructure and CI/CD environments.

---

## 🎯 What Problem Does PrivLabs Solve?

Many supply-chain incidents occur **before** any exploitation:

- weak sudoers configurations
- unsafe update mechanisms
- unpinned CI/CD dependencies
- exposed management interfaces
- insecure privilege boundaries

PrivLabs focuses on **early risk detection** —  
*before* a full penetration test, incident, or compliance failure.

## 🧩 What PrivLabs Analyzes

PrivLabs provides pre-audit visibility across critical attack surfaces:

- **Linux privilege escalation**
  - sudoers misconfigurations
  - SUID permission risks
  - PATH hijacking scenarios
- **Drupal supply-chain security**
  - update channels
  - signature trust
  - MITM exposure indicators
- **pfSense configuration audits**
  - management exposure
  - unsafe services
  - credential policies
- **CI/CD pipeline hardening**
  - unpinned third-party actions
  - dependency locking
  - artifact integrity risks
